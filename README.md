juts a webpage for my pc 

I usually find myself mindlessly scrolling getting distracted, while i'm trynna do a certain task, so i'vecreated this basic page which i'd load as my browser default homepage, this has just a background image and some links to the things i wanna acoomplish to something of that sort, like my lecturre link from youtube+ unhook extensiion for avoiding any unnecessary distraction. that's it for no, i'll trynna update later if i find something worth it!.
